# BME68X and BSEC2.0 for Python by pi3g

This Python extension enables you to read measurement data by the BME68X sensor and the BSEC2.0 library from BOSCH.<br>
The BME68X sensors by BOSCH Sensortec measure temperature, pressure and humidity.<br>
Most importantly the sensor estimates the air pollution by recording the amount of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds).<br>
With use of the (licensed) BSEC library from BOSCH, this allows for measuring the IAQ (Indoor Air Quality).<br>

**Check out this [Installation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGWKcCPKhIE&t=12s)!**

### How to install the extension without BSEC
```bash
pip3 install bme68x
```

### How to install the extension with BSEC
- clone [this repo](https://github.com/pi3g/bme68x-python-library) to a desired location on you hard drive
- download the licensed BSEC2.0 library [from BOSCH](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bme688-software/)<br>
- unzip it into the *bme68x-python-library-main* folder, next to this *README.md*
- open a new terminal window inside the *bme68x-python-library-main* folder
```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
or to install under venv use
```bash
path/to/venv/bin/python3 setup.py install
```
### How to use the extension
- to import in Python
```python
import bme68x
```
or
```python
from bme68x import BME68X
```
- see PythonDocumentation.md for reference
- to test the installation make sure you connected your BME68X sensor via I2C
- run the following code in a Python3 interpreter
```python
from bme68x import BME68X

# Replace I2C_ADDR with the I2C address of your sensor
# Either 0x76 (default for BME680) or 0x77 (default for BME688)
bme68x = BME68X(I2C_ADDR, 0)
bme68x.set_heatr_conf(1, 320, 100, 1)
data = bme68x.get_data()
```
